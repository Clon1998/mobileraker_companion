# First things first, we need to detect what kind of OS we are running on. The script works by default with all
# Debian OSs, but some printers with embedded computers run strange embedded OSs, that have a lot of restrictions.
# These must stay in sync with update.sh and uninstall.sh!
#

# The K1 and K1 Max run an OS called Buildroot. We detect that by looking at the os-release file.
# Quick note about bash vars, to support all OSs, we use the most compilable var version. This means we use ints
# where 1 is true and 0 is false, and we use comparisons like this [ "$IS_K1_OS" -eq 1 ]
IS_K1_OS=0
if grep -Fqs "ID=buildroot" /etc/os-release; then
    IS_K1_OS=1
    # On the K1, we always want the path to be /usr/data
    # /usr/share has very limited space, so we don't want to use it.
    # This is also where the github script installs moonraker and everything.
    HOME="/usr/data"
fi

# Next, we try to detect if this OS is the Sonic Pad OS.
# The Sonic Pad runs openwrt. We detect that by looking at the os-release file.
IS_SONIC_PAD_OS=0
if grep -Fqs "sonic" /etc/openwrt_release; then
    IS_SONIC_PAD_OS=1
    # On the K1, we always want the path to be /usr/share, this is where the rest of the klipper stuff is.

SCRIPT_DIR=$(readlink -f "$(dirname "$0")")
REPO_DIR=$(readlink -f "$SCRIPT_DIR/..")

# This is the root of where our py virtual env will be. Note that all instances share this same
# virtual environment. This how the rest of the system is, where all other services, even with multiple instances, share the same
# virtual environment. I probably wouldn't have done it like this, but we have to create this before we know what instance we are targeting, so it's fine.

# Note that this is parsed by the update process (Of Moonraker) to find and update required system packages on update!
# On update THIS SCRIPT ISN'T RAN, only this line is parsed out and used to install / update system packages.
# For python packages, the `requirements.txt` package is used on update.
# This var name MUST BE `PKGLIST`!!

# The virtualenv is for our virtual package env we create
# The curl requirement is for some things in this bootstrap script.
