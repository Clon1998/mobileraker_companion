Mobileraker provides you with two distinct options for sending custom notifications. Evaluate the features of each method to determine the one that aligns best with your specific requirements:

## Using `M117` with the Prefix `$MR$:`

Custom notifications can be achieved using the `M117` G-code command along with the `$MR$:` prefix. This method provides two variations for creating notifications:

- **Body-Only Notification**: Format: `M117 $MR$:<BODY>`. Example: `M117 $MR$:Hey, I am a notification`.

- **Title and Body Notification**: Format: `M117 $MR$:<TITLE>|<BODY>`. Example: `M117 $MR$:Printer Status|The printer has reached the target temperature`.

> [!TIP]
> Using `M117` is the simplest method. However, if your printer has a display attached, the entire `M117` message will be shown on it. If this is the case, the next option might be preferable.

## Using the `MR_NOTIFY` Custom Macro

This approach involves using the `MR_NOTIFY` G-code macro. To utilize this method, you need to include the `MR_NOTIFY` macro in your printer's configuration. The `MR_NOTIFY` macro has two parameters: `MESSAGE` and `TITLE`, where only `MESSAGE` is mandatory.

**Example Usage**: `MR_NOTIFY TITLE="I am $printer_name" MESSAGE="Feed me more Filament!"`

```properties
[gcode_macro MR_NOTIFY]
description: Allows you to send a custom notification via Mobileraker without using the M117 command
gcode:
    {% set msg = "MR_NOTIFY:" ~ (params.TITLE ~ "|" if 'TITLE' in params|upper else "") ~ params.MESSAGE %}

    {% if 'MESSAGE' in params|upper %}
        { action_respond_info(msg) }
    {% else %}
        { action_raise_error('Must provide MESSAGE parameter') }
    {% endif %}

```
> [!WARNING]
> Remember to include this macro in your printer's Klipper configuration file (e.g., printer.cfg). Do **NOT** include it in the mobileraker.conf file.

## Placeholders

> [!WARNING]  
> Custom notifications have been crafted with a mechanism to mitigate redundant notifications. Specifically, if an additional `M117`/`MR_NOTIFY` command is issued with content identical to a prior notification, Mobileraker guarantees that a new notification will not be triggered. This functionality is implemented to avoid unnecessary clutter in the user's notifications, ensuring that only novel and distinct information is conveyed.



When crafting your custom notification's title or body/message, you have the flexibility to incorporate placeholders that will be dynamically replaced by the companion. These placeholders allow you to convey specific information relevant to the notification context. Below is a list of available placeholders and their corresponding replacements:


| Placeholder Key       | Description                                                                                                                                                      | Condition                                                                  |
